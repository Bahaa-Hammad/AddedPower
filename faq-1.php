													<div class="acod-content">Prepare the car
														Apply the handbrake and remove all passengers from the car.
														
														Take the spare wheel and necessary tools out of the boot.
														
														2. Position the wheel chocks
														Chocks prevent the car from rolling while jacked up.
														
														Position a chock on the opposite wheel to the one with a puncture.
														
														For example, if your left-front tyre has a puncture, put a chock behind the right-rear wheel.
														
														If your left-rear tyre is flat, you need a chock in front of the right-front.
														
														Use chocks for both front/rear wheels (as appropriate) if you have them.
														
														Bricks or large rocks can do the same job if you don’t have a dedicated chock.
														
														3. Loosen the wheel nuts
														It’s easier – and safer – to do this while the car is on the ground.
														
														You may need to lever off a plastic wheel trim first.
														
														Turn the wheel wrench anti-clockwise and loosen the nuts to the point where they can be turned by hand (be warned – they may be tough to loosen).
														
														However, don’t remove them completely yet.
														
														4. Jack the car up
														All cars have dedicated jacking points – consult your handbook to see where these are.
														
														Aim to position the jack at the side of the car, close to the punctured wheel.
														
														Placing a small plank of wood under the jack will help keep it stable.
														
														Raise the car slowly until the flat tyre is 10-15cm off the ground.
														
														5. Remove the flat tyre
														Fully loosen and remove the wheel nuts, then gently pull the tyre towards you until it comes free.
														
														Place it flat on the ground.

														Garage speak – our guide to understanding car mechanic jargon
														12 simple car maintenance checks you should definitely be doing
														6. Mount the spare wheel
														Slide the spare wheel onto the protruding hub bolts, or in line with the wheel nut slots (warning: it’s heavy to lift it off the ground to do this).
														
														Replace the wheel nuts and tighten them by hand.
														
														7. Lower the car and tighten the bolts
														Use the jack to drop the car down slightly, so that the spare tyre is in contact with the ground.
														
														Now use the wrench to fully tighten the wheel nuts.
														
														8. Fully lower the car
														Bring the car fully down to earth and remove the jack.
														
														Consider giving the wheel nuts a final check for tightness.
														
														Stow the jack and the other tyre in the boot, along with the rest of your equipment.
														
														Note: if your car has a space saver, the old wheel will take up more space in the boot.
														
														9. Check the spare tyre pressure
														If you have one, use a tyre pressure gauge to check the spare wheel is fully inflated.
														
														Alternatively, drive carefully to a petrol station and use the gauge there.
														
														Pump up the tyre to the recommended pressure – as detailed in the handbook – if necessary.
														
														10. Take your punctured tyre for repair
														Visit a garage or tyre fitters at the first opportunity and give them your punctured wheel.
														
														They will advise whether to repair or replace it.
														
														Don’t drive on a space-saver spare wheel for longer than is strictly necessary – they are only intended for emergencies.
														
														If the tyre can't be repaired and you need to replace it, our guide to purchasing tyres may come in handy.

														Step 1. Power your car down
														To ensure safety, turn off your car and take the keys out of the ignition.
														
														Step 2. Open engine compartment
														Pop your car’s hood and locate the headlight holder, near the front of the car.
														
														Step 3. Disconnect the headlight bulb power wires
														There are usually three wires attached to the base of the lightbulb. Push down the clip or cap holding them in place.
														
														Step 4. Unscrew the old headlight
														Every car is different, Zullo cautions. “Some cars you can get right to the bulb, but with some cars you can’t,” he says. Sometimes the battery or the air filter housing is in the way and sometimes you have to take the inner fender out and get behind it.
														
														However, if you can open the headlight, it’s then just a matter of changing the halogen bulb. This means seeing how the bulb is locked in and carefully unlocking it. If you break the clips that are used here, though, you’ll need to take out the whole headlight, Zullo warns. “So you have to see how it’s hooked up, gently take it apart and then you have to reverse the procedure going back together without putting your fingers on the glass of the bulb,” he says.
														
														Step 5. Screw in the new headlight bulb
														Gently screw in the new bulb without touching the glass of the bulb; oil and dirt on your hands can cause the bulb to burst once it heats up. Close the hood of your car. With the new bulb in place, your headlights should once again be as good as new, and you can once again enjoy driving your car day or night.
														
														Most times, changing a headlight is straightforward and doesn’t require taking your car to a mechanic. Check out other DIY car maintenance projects anyone can do.</div>

														</a>
													</h6>
												</div>
												<div id="collapseThree4" class="acod-body collapse"
													data-bs-parent="#accordion4">
													<div class="acod-content">First, you'll want to lift the car high enough to give yourself room to work under it. Whether you use a hoist, ramps, or jack stands, make sure you are being absolutely safe. Never work under a car that is held up only by a floor jack. We raised our subject vehicle on the lift in the Car and Driver test garage, so you could see what we were doing. Most modern cars are fitted with a plastic undertray to both improve aerodynamics and protect vital components on the underside of the engine. In order to access the oil pan and oil filter on the TSX, the cover needs to be removed; most undertrays are held on with a mixture of bolts, screws, or plastic clips that can be unfastened with basic hand tools. Before step two, be sure to examine the area for oil leaks. If any are found, consider having your vehicle inspected by a mechanic.

														Step 2: Unplug It, Drain It
														Situate your oil receptacle—five-gallon bucket, oil drain pan (available at an auto-parts store), oil reservoir, or any other sizable liquid-holding container—in such a way that the oil will drain into it without getting all over the ground or otherwise making a mess. Remember, there will be a lot of oil: Most cars have at least a gallon in their crankcase, and some a lot more. Remove the drain plug by loosening it (counterclockwise) with the proper wrench and unscrewing it. Hold on to the drain plug as you remove it; the oil will start pouring out as you pull it away from the oil pan. Allow the engine to drain for five minutes or until the flow of oil has slowed to a trickle.
														Step 3: Off With the Old Filter
Find the oil filter. It's the softball-sized cylindrical component screwed onto the engine (though some engines have a housing that you slip a filter cartridge into). Using your hand or an oil-filter wrench (you'll likely need the latter), loosen the oil filter (turn counterclockwise) enough that the oil starts to come out of the top and drip down into your receptacle. Wait until the flow subsides and finish removing the filter. Before installing your new filter, be sure to verify that the old oil-filter gasket—a thin rubber O-ring—wasn't left behind. This is particularly important; if the old gasket is not removed, the new filter won't seal properly, which typically ends with all of your new, fresh oil leaking onto the ground within minutes of startup, potentially starving the engine of oil and leading to catastrophe. It is good practice to wipe down any oil-covered surfaces before you replace the drain plug and oil filter.

Step 4: Drain Plug in, Filter On
Replace the drain plug and tighten it until it's snug, but not too much: Overtightening can cause damage to the oil pan and drain plug. Put some effort into tightening it, but not all of your strength. Some manufacturers have a torque spec that you can follow, using a torque wrench. In any case, do not try to rip off the head of the drain plug. Certain vehicles use a washer behind the drain plug that must be replaced when you reinstall the plug (check your owner's manual to see if this washer needs to be replaced). Next, take your new oil filter and apply a light coating of oil (from a dab on the end of your finger) all around the rubber gasket on the top of the filter. This will help create a proper seal as you tighten the filter. The same rule applies when installing the filter: Don't screw too hard, but rather turn it until it's "hand tight" and then just a bit more, so it's snug.
Step 5: Fill It Back Up with Oil
Once you have replaced the oil filter and drain plug, reinstall your undertray and lower the car back to the ground. Open the hood and remove the oil cap, which should have an oil-can symbol on it. Using a funnel, fill the engine with the manufacturer's indicated volume of oil.

Step 6: Check the Oil Level, Check for Leaks
Finally, after waiting a few minutes for the oil to settle into the pan, use the dipstick to verify that your oil is at the proper level. Checking your oil is simple: Pull the dipstick from its tube, wipe away all oil with a paper towel, reinsert the dipstick, remove the dipstick, and confirm that the oil is lined up with the full marking on the tip of the dipstick. Finally, start the vehicle and let it idle and warm up; check for leaks under the vehicle and around the oil filter.

Congratulations! You've changed your oil and saved a bunch of money. Now, doesn't that feel great?
